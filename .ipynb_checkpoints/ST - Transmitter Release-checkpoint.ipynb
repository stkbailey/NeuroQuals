      "As a broad generalitzation, neural transmission is the result of calcium influx in the presynaptic terminal. Neither sodium nor potassium are required for neurotransmitter rlease. Each synaptic vesicle stores about 5000 neurotransmitter molecules. Increasing calcium influx changes the probability of vesiclces releasing their load, but not the actual size of the load. \n",
      "\n",
      "Calcium channels are clustered into \"active zones\" that see a high level of vesicule fusion, and calcium regulates the activity of a set of proteins important for vesicular release (i.e. targeting, docking, fusing and recycling). Finally, transmitter release can be modulated through intrinsic (potentiation) and extrinsic (synaptic facilitation/inhibition) processes."
