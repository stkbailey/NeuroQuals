      "Neuronal proteins are synthesized inthe ell body. Their function is determined by their amino acid sequence and foldying dynamics, although their final structure is often modified by the endoplasmic reticulum or golgi apparatus. Most secreted proteins are mode on ribosomes at the rough endoplasmic reticulum, then pushd to the embrane in vesicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Endocytosis is a process of recycling proteins, especially those at the membane. It allows protein transport to occur without modifying the steady-state composition of the cell. That is, it occurs in both directions, so one are of the cell does become overly concentrated with any one type of protein. In neurons, molecular motors like kinesin enable the molecules to be transported in both antero- and retro-grade fashionn along the axon."

      "The nucleus contains the DNA, or blueprint, for all proteins that must be manufactured in the cell. Each cell type has specific regulatory proteins that enter the nucleus and target certain sequences of the chromatin, creating messenger RNA (mRNA) that is exported with ribosomes from the nucleus. This mRNA then combines with free ribosomes to be synthesized.\n",
