      "Signalling uses three classes of receptors:  ionotropic receptors (fast, brief action); metabotropic GPCRs with 7 transmembrane segments; and receptor tyrosine kinases. The latter two types activate second messenger cascades or directly alter ion channel function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many cascades rely on protein kinases that phosphoylate cell proteins. The actions of metabotropic receptors can last seconds to minute and can modulate the strength/efficacy of synaptic transmission, including transmitter release, receptorsensitivity or membrane excitability. These actions are implicated in emotion, mood and arousal. The longest-lasting effects can change gene transcription but this may require repeated stimulation. "
