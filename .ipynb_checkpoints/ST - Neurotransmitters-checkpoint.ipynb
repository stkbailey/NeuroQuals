      "Neural signal is carried across the synapse by neurotransmitters. They do not carry unique info in themselves, but bind with receptors on the other cell to transmit the signal. NTs are packaged in vesicles after synthesis to protect from degradation and to prepare for release in the synaptic cleft. Small NTs are synthesized at the terminal; larger peptides in the soma. Therefore to understand NTs, we often study vesicles."
