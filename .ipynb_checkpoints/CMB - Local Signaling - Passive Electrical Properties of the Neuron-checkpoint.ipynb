      "Two needs drive evolution: neurons must be small to fit large numbers of them in the brain, and they must conduct signal rapidly. The cell membrane has a high capacitance, slowing down signals, and the cytoplasm in axon and dendrites acts as a relaively poor conductor. Furthermore, ion channels make cells leaky. Therefore, the cell has developed ways of compensating: myelination, increasing the size of axons, or both."
