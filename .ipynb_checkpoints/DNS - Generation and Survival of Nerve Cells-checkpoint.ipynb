    "1. Neurons and glia descend from common progenitor cells.\n",
    "2. Molecular signals determine the cellular fate of the progenitors.\n",
    "3. Some properties of mature neurons are further specified.\n",
    "4. Finally, some neurons are killed via apoptosis, or programmed cell death.\n",
    "\n",
    "An overabundance of neurons results in the apoptosis of many superfluous neurons. Intercellular signals are critical at every step of this process. Development requires a mechanism of identity acquisition (neuron vs. glia) and of survival. \n",
    "\n",
    "Much of our understanding of these processes comes from studies of drosophila (flies) and c. elegans (worms), but these processes appear to be heavily conserved across species."

    "\n",
    "Delta-Notch signalling determines the cell fate. The default fate is neuronal: activation of Notch by Delta suppresses this fate by inhibiting the transcription of Delta signals. This ensures that no \"clumps\" of neurons form, but the fate is not set initially.\n",

    "Another molecule, Numb, is inhibited by 1/2 the cells and forces neuronal determination. Thus there are both determinate and indeterminate signalling molecules. \n",

    "Development of the neurotransmitter phenotype has been mostly studied in sympathetic neurons (norepinephrine). Some of these neurons initially use NE, then start expressing ACh once they have contacted the target cell. For example, when sweat glands are transplanted elsewhere, they induce ACh expression in innervating neurons. However, this may not be universal; some neurotransmitters seem to be intrinsic to the neuron."
