      "The action potential is caused by ion flux which depolarizs the cell membrane. Fast Na<sup>+</sup> influx depolarizes the cell; K<sup>+</sup> repolarizes it. Diversity of channels can alter the firing rate of neurons. Most of our knowledge comes from voltage clamping experiments and analysis of the molecular structure of channels. These insights can better tell us about genetic diseases stemming from ion channel changes and help us develop better, more effective drugs."
