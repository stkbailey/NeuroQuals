      "Glutamate is the most common neurotransmitter, and it has three types of receptors (AMPA, kainate and NMDA). AMPA and Kainate mediate rapid Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> permeability changes, whereas NMDA mediates delayed Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> *and* Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. Thus, NMDA contributes to the *late* portion of the EPSP but also triggers important signalling pathways implicated in learning and memory.\n",

The ionotriopic GABA<sub>A</sub> channel allows Cl<sup>-</sup> influx, whereas the metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activates potassium channels and inhibits Calcium influx. These processes each hyperpolarize or inhibit depolarization of the cell.\n",

      "Thus, a single input neuron may not provide enough neurotransmitter to trigger an action potential. Furthermore, a single neuron may provide both inhibitory and excitatory inputs to different areas. For example, a spinal cord neuron may excite the hamstring, causing it to contract, while inhibiting the quadricep, ensuring that it does not provide antagonistic force.\n",
