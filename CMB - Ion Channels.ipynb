      "Ion channels are proteins that form pores in the cell membrane, allowing charged ions such as Na<sup>+</sup> to enter the cell. There are three important properties of ion channels:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Conduct ions across the cell membrane rapidly.** During depolarization, ions flow into/out of the cell at a rate of 100 million ions per channel per second. \n",
      "2. **Recognize and select for specific ions.** This is done with filtering mechanisms within the channel, including pore width and binding domains that prefer some ions over others. \n",
      "3. **Open or close in response to electrical, chemical or mechanical signals.** A huge variety of ion channels are responsible for the different sensations animals are capable of, including touch, taste and vision. \n",
      "\n",
      "The primary methods responsible for our increased understanding of channels are: the **patch-clamp technique**, which records current flow through single open channels; **gene cloning and sequencing**, which has shown genetic basis for these proteins and the relationships between families of channels; and finally, **x-ray crystallography** can show a 3D view of the channel."
