    "The expected lifespan for humans has dramatically increased in the past century. There are several reason: a decrease in infant mortality, vaccines and antibiotics, improved nutrition, better public health interventions, heart disease and stroke preventia. However, we are now seeing the problems associated with this longer life span. Dementia and cognitive/memory impairment is more prevalent.\n",

    "One possibility is that changes in information quality (i.e. DNA, RNA, protein integrity) accumulate over time as cells duplicate. Human cells can divide only a limited number of times in culture. Fibroblasts from older people divide fewer tims than ones from younger individuals. Galapagos turtle cells can divide 90 times, whereas mice divide 15. Human cells can divide about 50 times. The nucleus is the central piece of this \"biological clock\". "

    "The premier aging study is the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. It revealed that there is a wide variability in the rate and severity of cognitive decline. Among other things, sleep patterns change so that individuals get less stage III, IV and REM sleep. Structurally, brain weight decreases and senile plaques form. "

Neurofibrillary tangles also appear, and are made of tau and Amyloid Beta. The affected nerve cells eventually die, leaving the tangles behind. Thus synaptic inputs for memory are lost. Amyloid Beta is particularly prominent in Alzheimer's Disease.\n",
