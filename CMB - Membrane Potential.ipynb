The most important ions determining the membrane potential are Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup> and an assortment of organic anions. Ion channels either passively let cross or actively transport them back to maintain or recover the resting potential. \n",

At rest, K<sup>+</sup> is most permeable, so the potential is near -70mV; during an action potential, $V_m$ approaches +55mV, the equilibrium potential for Na<sup>+</sup>. This means that changes in potential are not caused by concentration changes, but by changes in permeability."

Using a pair of electrodes, they would place one tip in the extracellular fluid and the other in the cytoplasmic space. The electrodes could then measure the potential difference. Later, they would use another pair of electrodes, along with a current generator, to investigate how the membrane potential changed as a function of channel properties.\n",
