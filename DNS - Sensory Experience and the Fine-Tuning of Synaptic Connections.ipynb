    "\n",
    "Although development in many ways is preprogrammed, the creation of synapses requires experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two mechanisms in development: molecular guidance cues and patterned synaptic activity. In the visual system, activity leads to cooperation and competition between fibers from opposite eye. Syncrhonus stimulation strengthens synapses at all cooperating fibers, and innervation from the opposite eye retract. Ultimately, overlap is eliminated. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process occurs principally during the critical period. After this, the circuits are stable. The clinical relevance is clear: sensory development is mediated by both genetics and experience."

    "When Hubel & Wiesel blinded one eye in cats for 3-6 months, retinal cells were okay, but the cortical cells did not respond to visual stimulation. Further study showed that monocular deprivation resulted in the dominance of a single eye; binocular deprivation, on the other hand, resulted in a balanced dominance between the two. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deprivation of sight for one week as an infant can result in total vision loss. However, later in life, deprivation of an entire month can result in no vision loss. Infancy, therefore, is a \"critical period\" in neural development."

    "The timing of visual deprivation is important for influencing ODCs: during critical periods, terminals from the deprived eye become less active and retreat. At later stages, axons from the open eye extend outward. \n",

It is possible through spontaneous axon activation in utero, even before eyes open. Neighboring ganglion cells in the retina fire in bursts for a few seconds, followed by silent periods, allowing differentiation.\n",

    "Rene Spritz performed a study on infants raised in a foundling home (orphanage) versus a nursing home. Children in the foundling home were deprived sensory and socially because there were fewer staff members than children. Children in the nursing home, however, had a rotating staff of women that would shower affection on the children. By the end of year 1, motor and intellect was much better in the nursing home group. The foundling children developed a condition now known as \"hospitalism\". \n",
