    "# The Formation and Regeneration of Synapses\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three key events in synapse formation. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Form selective connections between developing axon and target.\n",
    "2. Differentiation of axon growth cone into presynaptic terminal.\n",
    "3. Elaboration of postsynaptic apparatus in target.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nerve terminal must recognize and targetcell. The posynaptic membrane must respond to neurotransmitters released by the axon. These processes must be tightly matched spatially and last a lifetime. \n",
    "\n",
    "Synaptogenesis is instructive. Pre- and post-synaptic fibers generate their own machinery, but they organize each other with electrical and chemical signals. One key signal is agrin, which activates MuSK for aggregating AChRs, leading to increased electrical activity.Retrograde signals include trophic factors and laminin. \n",
    "\n",
    "Axons can also regenerate and form new synapses after injury, especially in the peripheral nervous system.\n",

    "### Interactions between motor neurons and skeletal muscles organize the development of the neuromuscular junction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neuromuscular junction uses three types of cell: motor neurons, Schwann cells and muscle fibers. The axon has vesicles containing ACh and mitochondria. The terminal has Schwann cells that extend processes, forming a non-myelin layer over the terminal. The muscle terminal has \"junctional folds\" across from ACh active zones. Finally, a \"basal lamina\" containing molecules such as AChase ensheathes the entire muscle fiber.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Axon and myotube organize each other. The axon spits out ACh; myotube creates channels. However, in culture, they will form synapses but the initial contact is random. \n",
    "- New synaptic components are added in defined steps. Signals pass between cells to kick off each new step.\n",
    "- Axons and myotubes develop synaptic components independently. Axons release ACh before reaching the myotubule. Deleopmental signals are local, not global and assure that synapses are formed at the right time and place. \n",

    "\n",
    "ACh receptors are pentamers ($\\alpha \\beta$, 2 $\\delta$, 2 $\\gamma$). The majority are distributed, although some are clustered. Once the synapaes is formed, the receptors become highly concentrated, via three mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Translocation\n",
    "2. Increased transcription at synaptic areas\n",
    "3. Decreased transcription at non-synaptic areas\n",
